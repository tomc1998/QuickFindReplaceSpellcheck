# QuickFindReplaceSpellcheck
Program which 'spellchecks' a given file by looking up entries in a given list of mistakes and their corrections.

On windows, the dictionary.txt file must be in the same folder as the binary at runtime.

On other platforms, this is not supported, so the dictionary.txt file must be in the same directory as the one you're currently RUNNING from instead.
